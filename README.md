# Sam's Portfolio Website
<p>With a combination of YouTube tutorials, Stack Overflow and many resources online, I designed and curated my own portfolio website. The goal of this project was to practice current, modern frameworks and languages that are frequently used in web development (I.e., HTML, CSS and JavaScript). All pages, sections and components were designed by me, in hopes of showcasing my personality, originality and character. </p>

## Tech Stack 
<p>My portfolio website was built entirely on the React + Vite framework.</p> 
<li>React is a well-known JavaScript library that aims to help build intuitive, creative user interfaces, streamlining processes towards web application development. Vite also assists in the application development process, supporting languages such as TypeScript, JSX, CSS and more.</li>
<li>HTML5, a common markup language, was used to structure and present the overall skeleton for each webpage designed in this portfolio website.</li>
<li>CSS3 was subseequently applied to all components and pages, enhancing the overall aesthetic and presentation for the application to better reflect my personal style.</li>
<li>JavaScript was then used to add more responsiveness to the website, thereby making it more dynamic and responsive to a regular visitor.</li>
