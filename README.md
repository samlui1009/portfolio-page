# Sam's Portfolio Website
<p>With a combination of YouTube tutorials, Stack Overflow and many resources online, I designed and curated my own portfolio website. The goal of this project was to practice current, modern frameworks and languages that are frequently used in web development (I.e., HTML, CSS and JavaScript). All pages, sections and components were designed by me, in hopes of showcasing my personality, originality and character. </p>

## Tech Stack 
<p>My portfolio website was built entirely on the React + Vite framework.</p> 
<li>React is a well-known JavaScript library that aims to help build intuitive, creative user interfaces, streamlining processes towards web application development. Vite also assists in the application development process, supporting languages such as TypeScript, JSX, CSS and more.</li>
<li>HTML5, a common markup language, was used to structure and present the overall skeleton for each webpage designed in this portfolio website.</li>
<li>CSS3 was subseequently applied to all components and pages, enhancing the overall aesthetic and presentation for the application to better reflect my personal style.</li>
<li>JavaScript was then used to add more responsiveness to the website, thereby making it more dynamic and interactive to a regular visitor.</li>

## Relevant Dependencies
<li>React-Dom</li>
<li>React-Icons</li>
<li>React-Photo-Album</li>
<li>React-router-dom</li>
<li>Typed.js</li>

## Unique Features

### A Dynamic Typing Animation (Home)
<p>By employing the Typed.js library (Kindly developed by Matt Boldt), I was able to create a unique typing animation on the Home page, welcoming the user with a welcome message and my name.</p>

### A Navigation Bar for Ease of Scrolling Between Sections (About Me)
<p>In my initial iteration for my About Me page, I noted the excessive amount of scrolling that the user was required to do in order to reach the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>Thus, I was inspired to create an easier method of scrolling for the About Me page. With HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I crafted a Navigation Bar. Stationed just underneath the header of my website, this navigation bar allows the user to select which sub-section they would like to visit.</p>
<p>An animation (A smooth underline animation spanning the length of the sub-section) will appear upon cursor hovering.</p>
<p>Upon clicking, it guides the user seamlessly and smoothly towards their section of choice.</p>
<p>For further improvements, I hope to implement a "Scroll to Top" button on the side of the page. This will improve the overall user experience and also limit the amount of scrolling required to return to the top of the page.</p>

### A Photo Album, Dedicated to Showcasing Hobbies & Interests Outside of Programming (About Me)
<p>On my About Me page, I aimed to create a subsection outside of my programming-related and professional experiences to showcase my hobbies and interests as a photo gallery.</p>
<p>React-Photo-Album was the ideal choice for this for its freedom in customization. In order for the photographs to be rendered in its current layout, I created an array of photos (Photos.js) with pre-set sizes for width and height. </p>
<p>Documentation from React-Photo-Album was followed, ensuring that all photos would be displayed within the album container. The Rows layout was selected for the aesthetic design.</p>
<p>For further improvements, I hope to refine the photo album by adding more user interactivity, such as: Hover/on-click effects for photos; display randomization.</p>

### Dynamic Project Panels (Projects)
<p>Inspired by other portfolio websites, I wanted to display my current projects in a gallery-like format.</p>
<p>For further improvements</p>

### A Functional Message Form (Contact Me)
<p>On my Contact Me page, I wanted to create a message form.</p>
<p>For further improvements,</p>
