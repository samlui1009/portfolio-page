                    <p>ðŸ’» I am a current 3rd-year Bachelor of Computer Science second-degree student and <b>Information Technology Analyst intern</b> with Shared Services Canada, studying
                        at the <b>University of British Columbia</b> in Vancouver, B.C.</p>
                    <p>ðŸ’­ My exposure into the inefficiencies experienced within public healthcare had motivated 
                        my career transition. My current career goals are to eventually bring innovative, scalable solutions to the rapidly evolving 
                        digital health spaces. </p>
                    <p>ðŸ’¡ I'm always open to collaborations and chatting with other like-minded individuals about projects, hobbies and favourite bubble tea places (My personal favourite: <b><a href="https://www.yifangtea.com/" target="_blank">YiFang Fruit Tea)</a></b> ðŸ§‹
